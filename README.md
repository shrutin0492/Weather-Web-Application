# Weather-Web-Application

This project is a simple web application designed to display the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed of a city entered by the user. The application fetches real-time weather data from a weather API- [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) and presents it in a user-friendly interface.
